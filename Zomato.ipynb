The sizzling mexicana comes with a cheese patty is the most right combination that makes you doubt you're own marriage. However, if you don't mind something sweet, the barbecue sizzler with paneer can add sweetness to your life with every bite.

I wouldn't recommend the cheesecake, that is something they have to improve on.\\\\nIt's Affordable and for 3 sizzlers, one pizza, 2 zomato gold the bill came upto just 600.
